# Marketing Projects
This is a 3 part study that builds on each other. I am currently working on Project 2. 

**Project 1**  
Customer segmentation to help grocery store to better understand their customerâ€™s needs to develop micro-marketing strategies to help them boost revenue and gain customer loyalty.

**Project 2**  
Build a recommender system to help Nestle in promoting its chocolate products to increase its overall market share of the category.
 - The customers that will be targeted
 - For each targeted customer, which product is being promoted with an offer

**Project 3**  
Your analytics consulting firm was selected by Pernalonga (the client) to adjust list (shelf) prices to improve revenue. As supplier-funded in-store temporary price reductions on products are still being negotiated, you can assume the same promotion schedule as the same week in 2017, i.e., timing and product temporary price reduction levels are the same for corresponding weeks in 2017 and 2021. 
Your price change recommendations should be realistic, reasonable and justified with price elasticity measures.  Minimum requirements:
 - a list of 100 products with recommended price changes and justifications
 - expected changes in sales quantity, revenue and profitability for each store and overall across 10 stores

**Case description:** Pernalonga, a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga regularly partners with suppliers to fund promotions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions. Your analytics consulting firm is being considered by Pernalonga (the client) to develop a marketing campaign to experiment on personalized promotions.
